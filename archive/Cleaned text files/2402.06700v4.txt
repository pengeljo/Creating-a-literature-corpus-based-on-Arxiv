Introduction


The capability of large language models (LLMs) to function as
intelligent agents has been showcased across various domains, such as
mathematical research *REF*, data science *REF*, software
engineering *REF*, and geoscience *REF*. Given these
developments, there is an increasing interest in enhancing their
functionality in interactive decision-making
contexts *REF*. Historically, the enhancement of LLMs
has relied heavily on the crafting of precise prompts and the provision
of high-quality examples for in-context learning or supervised fine-tuning (SFT) *REF*.
Fortunately, employing reinforcement learning (RL) *REF* offers a dynamic approach for LLMs to
actively participate and progressively refine their performance in
task-specific environments through a process of exploration and
feedback. This shift towards RL allows for a reduction in dependency on
manually prepared examples and prompts, paving the way for more
autonomous and adaptive learning capabilities in LLMs.


Although RL is inherently designed for tackling problems in interactive
environments, its direct application *REF* for fine-tuning language models encounters two significant gaps. The
first pertains to a pronounced misalignment in learning objectives.
Specifically, while the goal of language modeling is to approximate the
probability distribution of tokens in the corpus, RL focuses on the
maximization of quantified rewards (which in return has optimal
state-action distribution, a.k.a. occupancy measure or policy, with
maximized long-term discounted return). Such a focus, however,
predisposes the model to overfitting risks *REF*. This
fundamental divergence undermines the preservation of the original token
distribution in language models, a critical aspect for maintaining
linguistic coherence and diversity *REF*.


The emergence of a second gap is attributed to the variations in
optimization granularity. RL typically focuses on optimizing at the
action level, whereas language modeling targets optimization at the
token level. This discrepancy leads to two primary issues: 1) The action
space for LLMs, consisting of sequences of tokens, is exponentially
vast, leading to increased instability and convergence difficulties
during the RL fine-tuning process *REF*. 2) The reward
signals at the action level are overly sparse for sequences of tokens,
complicating the provision of precise, fine-grained supervision for
complex tasks. This results in obstacles in assigning credit to
individual tokens and misalignment between token generation and action
performance *REF*. For instance, RLHF *REF* seeks to bridge the first gap by integrating a
KL divergence term within the reward signal. However, the effectiveness
of this approach is heavily dependent on an additional reward model that
delivers dense token-level reward signals. Despite this, applying RLHF
with action-level rewards still encounters the aforementioned
difficulties, which are elaborately analyzed in
Section *REF*. Moreover, RLHF conceptualizes token
sequences as temporal relations, which hinders its utility in multi-step
interactive settings. This limitation stems from a confusion between
assigning credit within a single action and across multiple actions.


In this paper, we take several steps to bridge these gaps between RL and
language modeling. Initially, to mitigate the risk of the LLM policy
diverging excessively during RL fine-tuning, we incorporate interactive
tasks within the entropy-regularized reinforcement learning (ERL)
framework, which reinterprets the RL problems through the lens of
probability theory and constrains the policy update with a given
distribution *REF*. Thus we can naturally bridge the first gap in learning objectives, i.e.
aligning the demand for improving task-specific performance with the
objectives of language modeling. Then, to address the second gap
concerning optimization granularity, we propose the per-token soft
Bellman update and per-token policy update. They decompose the Q
function *REF* and policy optimization within ERL
from the action level to the token level, backed by theoretical proof
affirming their consistency in optimization. This decomposition reduces
the complexity growth of action space exploration as context length from
multiplicative to additive, thus stabilizing the learning process.
Besides, it provides fine-grained credit assignment, further ensuring
that each token generation is directly correlated with action
performance. Unlike RLHF, our method distinctly maintains the separation
between intra-action and inter-action credit assignments during
token-level policy updates, enhancing its effectiveness in multi-step interactions.


As a natural outcome of our findings, we propose Entropy-regularized
Token-level Policy Optimization (ETPO), a concrete RL algorithm that
leverages the per-token soft Bellman update and policy update to enhance
LLM agents&apos; capabilities within interactive environments. Our
experiments confirm the effectiveness of ETPO in narrowing the gaps in
both learning objectives and optimization granularity. We justify such a
claim by evaluating ETPO in an environment that simulates data science
code generation as multi-step interactive tasks; results show that ETPO
achieves effective performance improvement on the CodeLlama-7B
model *REF* and surpasses a variant PPO *REF* baseline inherited from RLHF.

LLMs for Interactive Tasks


In many works like Self-Refine *REF*, ReAct, Reflexion, or
ProTeGi *REF*, they &quot;verbally&quot; tell the model how to
iteratively improve the quality of what they generated. Reasoning via
Planning (RAP) *REF* combines the Monte Carlo Tree Search
(MCTS) with LLMs&apos; self-evaluation mechanism, to balance the exploration
and exploitation in the vast reasoning space.
Self-Rewarding *REF* allows LLMs to prompt themselves to
provide rewards during training. These works excel in numerous tasks,
yet their success hinges on the foundational models possessing robust inherent capabilities *REF*.


RL4LMs *REF* build an open-source framework for
optimizing language generators interactively with RL algorithms.
CodeRL *REF* generates code as actions and optimizes in an RL
framework using an actor-critic setup to debug programs given feedback
from the runtime environment. To align the objective of token-level
optimization with action-level optimization, GLAM *REF* 
estimates the probability of possible actions with the conditional
probability of tokens composing the actions, and updates the action as a
whole with the PPO algorithm. Nevertheless, the effectiveness of these
reinforcement learning-based approaches is constrained by the
excessively large action space encountered during exploration and the
lack of fine-grained supervision *REF*.


Entropy-Regularized Reinforcement Learning


methods *REF* are a subset of reinforcement learning that aims to search for the
optimal stochastic policy under the constraints of a given distribution.
ERL constrains the learned policy from deviating too far from a
reference distribution by adding an entropy-regularized term to the
reward function and optimizing with soft Bellman
update *REF*. A concrete instance of ERL is the
Soft Actor-Critic *REF* algorithm, which defines the *MATH* to be a uniform distribution to
balance the trade-off between exploration (entropy maximization) and
exploitation (reward maximization). While PPO and some other
Actor-Critic methods *REF* also encourage exploration by
adding an entropy term as a penalty to the loss function, this penalty
only takes effect in the current time step. RLHF *REF* that
adopts a variant of PPO with a KL term added to its reward function
could also be seen as an approximation to ERL.


Language-Augmented Sequential Decision-Making


Sequential decision-making problems with linguistic inputs and outputs
can be framed as a language-augmented Markov Decision Process (MDP) *REF* *MATH*.
Given a vocabulary *MATH* and tokens *MATH* are
the state space and action space respectively, which all consist of sequences of tokens. *MATH* is the
state transition function. *MATH* is the reward function and *MATH* is the discounted factor.


When we introduce an LLM as policy *MATH*, at time step *MATH*,
*MATH* receives a textual state *MATH* from the environment
as input and generates an action *MATH*. The action *MATH* 
is normally a sentence or phrase that consists of a sequence of token
*MATH* and generated in an auto-regressive
manner token-by-token. Then, the generated textual action *MATH* will be
mapped to the specific API call or command and executed in an
interactive environment *REF*. After execution, the
environment returns a reward signal *MATH* along with the next
state *MATH*, according to the transition *MATH*.


Entropy-Regularized Reinforcement Learning


One gap between RL and language modeling is that they hold different
learning objectives. While LLMs aim to model the probability
distribution of tokens within a corpus *REF*,
traditional RL focuses on maximizing the discounted cumulative return:
*MATH* which is prone to overfitting *REF*.
Directly applying RL to LLMs poses significant risks of disrupting the
well-calibrated token distribution of LLMs and thus impairs the
diversity and readability of language expressions that are essential for language models.


Fortunately, there have been many studies *REF* 
trying to couch the RL problem in the parlance of probability theory and
develop a set of ERL methods. The expected entropy-regularized return
which ERL targets to maximize is: *MATH* where *MATH* 
is the KL divergence between the learning policy *MATH* and reference
policy *MATH* is a scalar coefficient to balance the
influence between reward signals and KL divergence. The corresponding
soft Bellman update for the Q function is: *MATH*.
Equation indicates that the objective of ERL is
constrained with a given probability distribution *MATH*. Thus, by
assigning the *MATH* with an original LLM *MATH* in
Equation, we can smoothly bridge the gap in
learning objectives between RL and language modeling, i.e. maximizing
the cumulative return while maintaining the original token distribution as much as possible.


Action-Level and Token-Level Policy Optimization 


Another gap between RL and language modeling is the differences in the
granularity of optimization. In most traditional reinforcement learning
scenarios with discrete action spaces, actions are typically
inseparable, thus rendering the action space *MATH*,
where *MATH* is the number of available actions. However, as described in
Section *REF*, when we introduce LLMs as policies, an
action *MATH* consists of a sequence of tokens *MATH* 
generated by the LLM. In this case, since each token has an independent
search space with vocabulary size *MATH*, the action space
will experience an exponential explosion as the length of the context
increases: *MATH*, where *MATH* is the context
length. Thus, directly optimizing for the entire action shown in
Equation *REF* needs to explore an enormous action space, e.g.
*MATH* and *MATH* in our experimental setting, and thus
suffer from instability and difficulty in converging during RL
fine-tuning. *MATH* Besides, a reward signal is obtained after executing a
complete action, which is too sparse to provide fine-grained supervision
for each token. Applying it to all tokens within an action as
Equation *REF* might lead to a misalignment between token
generation and action performance, where each token holds different
importance in expressing the overall meaning and effectiveness of an
action *REF*. *MATH* For instance, while a language model-generated code
yielding positive returns doesn&apos;t imply that each line is beneficial,
discarding certain useless or harmful segments could enhance overall
outcomes, provided the algorithm identifies them during optimization.


Inspired by the decomposition for high-dimensional continuous actions or
multi-agent joint actions *REF*, we can
consider sequentially decomposing the optimization from the action level
into the token level as well. While reducing the growth of action space
as the length of token sequence from *MATH* to
*MATH* and enabling fine-grained credit assignment,
we should ensure the consistency in the optimization process before and after decomposition.


Entropy-Regularized Token-Level Policy Optimization


FIGURE


Based on the motivation discussed in
Sections *REF* and *REF*, we propose a concrete token-level ERL
algorithm that yields the highest expected entropy-augmented return,
i.e. the Equation *REF*. The intuition behind our method is to
decompose a textual action into a sequence of tokens and backpropagate
proper credit for each token with a variant of soft Bellman update, i.e.
the per-token soft Bellman update in
Equation *REF*. That way, we can learn a
token-level soft Q-function, bypassing the requirement to calculate a
precise *MATH*. After learning the soft Q-function, we can update policy *MATH* by minimizing
the KL divergence between it and the exponent of the learned soft
Q-function, the per-token policy update in
Equation *REF*. Figure *REF* illustrates the workflow of our proposed method.


FIGURE


Per-Token Soft Bellman Updates


Decomposing an action into a sequence of tokens,
*MATH*, where *MATH* is the tokens and *MATH* 
is the length of the sequence, we extend the soft Bellman update in
Equation *REF* to a per-token view of actions, and define
a per-token soft Bellman update in
Equation *REF*. For a time step *MATH*,
*MATH* denotes the sequence of tokens in action *MATH* from the
first token *MATH* to the *MATH* -th token *MATH*, i.e.
*MATH*. Then we define the soft Q-value of the
*MATH* -th token *MATH* conditioned on the textual state *MATH* and previous
action tokens *MATH* in an auto-regressive manner, without
discount when *MATH* (first line in the equation). When *MATH*,
The reward *MATH* is applied to the last token (second line in the
equation), as we do not receive any reward before executing the whole
action. Besides, we discount the expected Q-value and KL-divergence
which are conditioned on the next state *MATH* and the corresponding
first token *MATH*. In short, we only discount Q-values between the
time steps and keep the discounted factor at 1.0 for all but the last
token within actions in each time step.


After this decomposition, The most important thing is to make sure
whether it will disturb the alignment between token generation and
action selection. By decomposing each action into a sequence of tokens
for the soft Bellman update following the
Equation *REF*, we do not change the general
optimization properties and the principle of the Bellman optimality
still holds for a given MDP. We theoretically maintain the consistency
between the objective of token-level optimization and action-level
optimization, where the proof is left in Appendix *REF*.


With this per-token soft Bellman update, we can ensure the generation
process for each token toward maximizing the expected cumulative return,
that is, predicting the next token is directly incentivized to solve the
decision-making problem in an interactive environment currently.
Additionally, we can bypass the calculation for precise
*MATH* that suffers from an unmanageable computational complexity of *MATH*, instead, we just need
to calculate *MATH* token-level expected values
*MATH*, which enjoys a tractable complexity of *MATH*.


Per-Token Policy Update


After defining the soft Bellman backup, we develop an approach for the
policy update, i.e. the per-token policy update. According to the
definition of ERL *REF*, an optimal stochastic
policy that refers to *MATH* and the Q-function could be presented as:
FORMULA.


Due to the discrete nature of vocabularies, we can explicitly calculate
the *MATH* with *MATH* and current Q function
*MATH*, and thus update the policy toward minimizing
the KL-divergence between *MATH* and
*MATH*, which is somewhat similar to the
policy update process in SAC *REF*. Our
per-token policy update scheme is to minimize the objective *MATH* in Equation *REF*.


A Practical Algorithm


In practice, we draw a concrete algorithm of ETPO with pseudo-code shown
in the Algorithm *REF*. Since we don&apos;t want the learned strategy to
deviate too far from the original LLM, we constraint the distribution to
the original language model *MATH* by setting the reference policy
*MATH*. As for pre-trained LLMs, their output distribution
implies their preference for each token, thus the soft Q-network
*MATH* is initialized with *MATH* as well. Besides, Our algorithm
makes use of a target soft Q-network *MATH* to facilitate a
stable learning process, whose parameters are updated softly.


FORMULA


Experiments 


In this section, we evaluate our method by modeling data science code
generation tasks as interactive decision-making environments and
training a 7B CodeLlama model with ETPO. Based on the experimental
results, we discussed the superiority of our method over several
baselines in generating machine learning code to achieve the highest
possible ROC AUC score *REF* with Scikit-learn
module *REF*. We also showcase the convergence
performance of ETPO, which is important for evaluating RL algorithms.
Further, we analyze the difference between the generated code of vanilla
CodeLlama-7B and the CodeLlama-7B fine-tuned by ETPO, giving insights
about the behavioral emergence of LLMs with RL training. In the end, we
examine the perplexity with the benchmarks of Github, Wikitext, and
arXiv *REF* to confirm if ETPO can maintain the model&apos;s
fundamental capabilities and stability. Ablation studies are conducted
in Appendix *REF* to investigate the importance of multi-step
reflection and per-token soft Bellman update separately.


Environmental Setup 


To make the experiment closer to real industrial scenarios, we build an
interactive environment that models machine learning code writing and
debugging tasks into a sequential decision-making problem. With the same
testbeds as *REF*, we adopt 4 Kaggle datasets and 10
OpenML datasets *REF*, with details in Table *REF*.


TABLE


To model the code generation tasks as MDPs, we define
*MATH* to be the task description, *MATH* to
be the runtime error message when generated codes are non-runnable,
serving as reflection messages. In the beginning, our agent generates
codes as an action *MATH* based on the initial state *MATH* where
*MATH* is a prompting operation, then receives a reward *MATH* by executing
the codes. The reward function *MATH* is defined as: *FORMULA* 
When the codes are executed successfully, a done signal
will occur immediately, along with a ROC AUC score *MATH*. If the
codes run wrong, the agent receives a constant *MATH* as a reward, as
well as the next state *MATH*.
Appendix *REF* provides concrete examples of the prompts
and generated codes. In addition to successful code execution, a done
signal will also be received if *MATH* reaches a pre-set maximum step
limit, e.g. *MATH* in our experiments.


Adopting the same evaluation metrics as *REF*, for each
dataset, we evaluate 5 repetitions, each with a different random seed
and train-validation split to reduce the variance stemming from these
splits *REF*. We split into *MATH* train and
*MATH* validation samples and all methods used the same splits. We
record the highest reward explored by each method within a given number
of environment steps *MATH* as the main criteria for judgment, similar to evaluating AutoML tasks *REF*.


Main Results


FIGURE


TABLE


Figure *REF* shows the trends of average performance of
ETPO and three related baseline methods across *MATH* datasets under
different exploration intensities, i.e. *MATH*. More specifically,
Table *REF* shows the highest reward explored by these
methods for each dataset within *MATH* interactive steps. Among these
baselines, the Reflection keeps the interactive pipeline of ETPO
unchanged but removes the training process as a reference for LLMs&apos;
initial performance. Besides, similar to RLHF, we also implement an
action-level PPO with KL term in the reward function:
*MATH*, based on the same framework as ETPO to fine-tune CodeLlama-7B model, i.e. PPO-KL.
As an action-level algorithm, PPO-KL will assign the same credit to all tokens in an action.


From Figure *REF*, we observe that the performance of the
Reflections hardly changes as the number of exploration steps increases
from *MATH* to *MATH*, which means *MATH* is enough to touch the caps of
the Reflection with vanilla models. Comparing the Reflection with
PPO-KL, we confirm that even action-level RL training can slightly
improve the model&apos;s ability to generate better code for specific
datasets. Further, ETPO outperforms both Reflection and PPO-KL in most
of the experimental datasets, which verifies the effectiveness of our method.


Convergence


FIGURE


In this section, we take four Kaggle datasets to further analyze the
learning process of PPO-KL and ETPO in depth. To this end, we record the
average reward of generated codes in each batch during the training
process, instead of the best reward in the previous section. It is also
an important indicator for evaluating the convergence performance and stability of RL algorithms *REF*.
Figure *REF* shows the average performance on 4 Kaggle
datasets achieved by PPO-KL and ETPO as well as the average rewards of
Reflection with GPT-4 and CodeLlama-7B after 500 interactions.


According to Figure *REF*, although the best codes explored by GPT-4
and CodeLlama-7B enjoy similar rewards for each dataset in the previous
section, it does not mean that CodaLlama-7B has equal capabilities to
GPT-4. The huge gap between CodeLlama-7B and GPT-4 in average rewards
shown in Figure *REF* implies that a significant portion of the
code generated by CodeLlama-7B is non-runnable and therefore receives a
-1 as a reward which brings down the average. This illustrates that
vanilla CodeLlama-7B is more unstable than GPT-4 before training. Then,
as training progresses, the average performance of PPO-KL and ETPO has
improved significantly. Especially PPO-KL, because it allows all tokens
in an action to share credit, it can backpropagate the impact of the
reward signal to the front end of the token sequence earlier and thus
enjoy faster performance improvements. However, the credit assignment
granularity of PPO-KL is too large and not precise enough, which
prevents further improvement of its performance and brings instability
to the convergence process, as shown in the second half of the curve. In
contrast, ETPO spreads the impact of reward signals token-by-token. Thus
its performance improvement is relatively gentle in the early stage.
But, benefit from its fine-grained credit assignment, its improvement
process is more stable and converges to average performance exceeding
PPO-KL even the Reflection with GPT-4.


Behavioural emergence with RL training


Let&apos;s take a deeper investigation into the behavior of LLM after RL
training. In Figures *REF* and *REF* at
Appendix *REF*, we demonstrate the difference of generated
codes between the vanilla CodeLlama-7B and the CodeLlama-7B fine-tuned
with ETPO. The code generated by the trained model in
Figure *REF* indicates the effectiveness of
entropy-regularized RL in preventing the policy from moving too far and
losing the coherence and readability of generated text.


In addition to the difference in code complexity, another significant
difference between Figures *REF* and *REF* is that the code generated by the vanilla
model is more in line with the prompt requirements, i.e. returning a
Scikit model, while the code generated by RL trained model deviates
from prompt to a certain extent, i.e. it builds a pipeline with data
processing operation. This situation is similar to the
hallucination *REF* issue in the text-generation tasks that
needed to be avoided. However, this deviant code in fact achieves higher
rewards for the corresponding dataset. From an RL perspective, this
situation is easy to understand. Since RL algorithms encourage agents to
further explore directions with higher rewards, even unexpected
behaviors with high rewards will be continuously enhanced and improved
in the subsequent training process. Finally, models are promoted to
generate the complex and &quot;noncompliant&quot; code in
Figure *REF*, which achieves better performance than
code generated by repeated exploration without RL training.
Figure *REF* gives a more detailed demonstration of how this process occurs.


Further, this phenomenon inspires us an insight that we can filter the
hallucination of LLMs with the exploration-exploitation
manner *REF* of RL to boost the emergence of new
behaviors or capabilities. Limited by token length, it isn&apos;t easy to
encode all task-related information into prompts. The hallucination
could be treated as supplemental explorations in an
exploration-exploitation manner. we can filter out those that are
beneficial to the specific task and reinforce them to promote new
behaviors, instead of deliberately preventing it. On the other way, even
those hallucinations that are useless for the current task may still be
able to contribute to other tasks with techniques like hindsight
relabelling *REF* to boost the emergence of new
capabilities. In other words, for LLM agents with RL, hallucination is
the source of creativity and innovation that drives agents&apos; performance
improvement. By embracing the inherent uncertainty and variability in
the outputs of LLMs, we can harness their potential with serendipitous discoveries.


Affect on Perplexity


We choose benchmarks Github, Wikitext, and arXiv introduced by
memorizing transformers *REF* to observe the perplexity
changes compared to the original model after training by ETPO.


TABLE


According to the experimental results in
Table *REF*, the minor changes observed after training
the CodeLlama-7B model using the ETPO method indicate that this method
has a relatively small impact on the original language modeling. This
slight variation suggests that although the ETPO method may introduce
new optimization or training strategies, it does not fundamentally alter
or disrupt the basic logic of language modeling. This is a positive
outcome, as it means that while trying to improve model performance or
introduce new training methods, the model&apos;s fundamental capabilities and stability are maintained.


In the process of training and optimizing language models, maintaining
the model&apos;s understanding of language structure is crucial. Minor
performance improvements or changes indicate that your method may be
effective in subtly adjusting the model to suit specific tasks or
datasets without sacrificing the model&apos;s generality and foundational
language abilities. This balance is very important, especially in the
development of models that can be broadly applied across different linguistic tasks and domains.


Conclusion


In this work, we present the ETPO, a token-level optimization approach
that leverages entropy-regularized reinforcement learning to train LLM
agents for verbal sequential decision-making tasks. ETPO decomposes the
optimization in action space to token space and theoretically proves
their consistency. Our experiments also confirm the effectiveness of
ETPO from different dimensions. Moreover, we acknowledge the existing
limitations of ETPO, i.e. the requirement for a quantitative reward
function, which is not easily attainable in some textual environment. To
mitigate this issue, we envisage integrating ETPO with
self-rewarding *REF* or hindsight relabeling *REF* techniques and leave detailed
exploration for future research endeavors.
